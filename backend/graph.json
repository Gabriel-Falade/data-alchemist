The team has decided to use MongoDB for primary data storage due to its flexibility with unstructured data.\n\n## Key Decisions\n- **Database:** MongoDB (document store)\n- **Architecture:** Microservices\n- **Deployment:** AWS ECS\n- **Timeline:** 6 months\n\n## Team\nEngineering lead: Sarah Chen\nProduct: Mike Davis\n\n## Budget\nInitial budget: $50,000 for infrastructure\n",

Query times have increased 300%.\n\n## New Recommendation\nThe team now recommends migrating to PostgreSQL with proper indexing. The \"flexibility\" of MongoDB has actually created schema chaos.\n\n## Action Items\n- Evaluate PostgreSQL migration cost\n- Prototype new schema design\n- Timeline: 2 month migration window\n\n**Note:** This contradicts our January decision but is necessary for scale.\n",
